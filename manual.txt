The operation manual for the algorithm and all of its parts:

The algorithm allows you to see what is going on inside by providing with algorithm streams. There are three algorithm streams:

Algorithm Streams:

1: Allows you to see the rectangles being generated by the algorithm (spam warning).
2: Allows you to see rectangles that have passed the condition.
3: Allows you to see rectangles that have failed the clone test. The clone test is an advanced system that stops same rectangles with different order of points to pass.
If the clone test was not added, the algorithm would be extremely wrong.

An algorithm stream can be unlocked (enabled) or locked (disabled).

We use a three digit number consisting of only the digits 1 and 0 to describe if each algorithm stream is unlocked. Examples are 101, 100, 000, and 111.
Each digit maps to an algorithm stream, starting with the leftmost digit. For example, in 001, The first 0 maps to stream 1, and so on.
0 is for locking the stream, and 1 is for unlocking the stream.
So, if I do 101, I am unlocking only the first and third stream.
