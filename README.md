# CompetitiveProgrammingMath-RectangleParty
This is a competitive programming submission I made to a programming challenge. I got 2nd place with some other dude, and me and him were the only ones to solve it. The challenge is still at the Math Server on discord. The challenge was given 200 coordinates such that |x| <= 20, |y| <= 20, find all possible rectangles you can make with these 200 coordinates that are adjacent to the X axis or the Y axis. I think this program really does demonstrate my passion for math and computer science. I love mathematics, and I love to go ahead for fun.
